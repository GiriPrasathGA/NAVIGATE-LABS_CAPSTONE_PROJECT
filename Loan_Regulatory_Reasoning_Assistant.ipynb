        "This capstone project focuses on the domain of Banking and Financial Regulation, with a specific emphasis on Prompt Engineering and Context Engineering, rather than model training or fine-tuning. The objective is to design and implement a Regulatory Reasoning Assistant that interprets the FDIC RMS Manual of Examination Policies – Section 3.2 (Loans) to support regulatory-aligned loan analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assistant is designed to help users understand regulatory expectations, identify documentation gaps, and highlight areas requiring clarification under FDIC guidance. All responses are strictly grounded in the provided regulatory text, and the system explicitly avoids loan approval, rejection, or recommendation decisions."

        "EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE BASE\n",
        "\n",
        "1. INTRODUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS\n",
        "Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires federal banking agencies to establish safety and soundness standards for insured depository institutions. These standards address asset quality, earnings, stock valuation, and internal controls. The \"Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness\" (Appendix A to Part 364) specifically dictate that institutions must identify, measure, monitor, and control credit risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The loan portfolio typically represents the largest asset class and the most significant source of risk to a bank’s capital. Consequently, the examiner’s evaluation of the loan portfolio—including lending policies, credit administration, and the quality of individual loans—is the most critical aspect of the examination process. This evaluation directly determines the \"Asset Quality\" component of the CAMELS rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. LOAN ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE\n",
        "\n",
        "Lending Policy Requirements\n",
        "The board of directors is ultimately responsible for the institution's lending function. They must formulate, approve, and review (at least annually) a written lending policy. This policy acts as the governing document for all credit activities and must clearly address:\n",
        "- The trade area and acceptable types of loans.\n",
        "- Lending authority limits for specific officers and committees.\n",
        "- Guidelines for unsecured loans and portfolio diversification.\n",
        "- Interest rate policies and repayment terms.\n",
        "- Limitations on Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios.\n",
        "- Guidelines for obtaining and reviewing real estate appraisals.\n",
        "- Environmental risk management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Loan Review Systems\n",
        "Every institution must maintain an effective internal loan review system. The primary objective is to promptly identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize loss.\n",
        "- Independence: To ensure objectivity, loan review personnel should be independent of the lending function.\n",
        "- Scope: The system must validate the accuracy of internal risk ratings (grades) assigned by loan officers.\n",
        "- Reporting: Findings, including a list of identified deficiencies and required corrective actions, must be reported directly to the board of directors or a board committee.\n",
        "\n",
        "Credit Grading Systems\n",
        "An accurate grading system is the foundation of portfolio management. It should capture the risk of every loan and reconcile with regulatory classification definitions (Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, Loss). This grading drives the determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ALLL / ACL)\n",
        "Institutions must maintain a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses associated with the loan and lease portfolio.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methodologies:\n",
        "- Incurred Loss (ALLL): Historically used model where losses are recognized when they are probable and reasonably estimable.\n",
        "- Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL / ACL): Under ASC 326, institutions estimate losses over the contractual life of the asset. This requires forecasting based on historical data, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Responsibility:\n",
        "Management must evaluate the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly. The analysis should document factors such as historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, the volume of past-due and nonaccrual loans, and current economic indicators.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL (C&I) LOANS\n",
        "\n",
        "Working Capital Loans\n",
        "These are short-term extensions of credit designed to finance seasonal business needs, such as the purchase of inventory or the carrying of accounts receivable. Repayment is expected to come from the conversion of these current assets into cash (the operating cycle).\n",
        "\n",
        "Term Loans\n",
        "Term loans have maturities exceeding one year and are typically used to acquire capital assets (machinery, equipment, plant expansion). Because the repayment horizon is longer, these loans carry higher risk and require strong cash flow analysis to ensure the borrower can service the debt while maintaining operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Accounts Receivable Financing\n",
        "This is a specialized form of lending where the borrower assigns their interest in accounts receivable to the lender as collateral. It is high-risk and requires strict controls:\n",
        "- Blanket Assignment: The borrower periodically reports the total amount of receivables.\n",
        "- Ledgering: The lender receives duplicate invoices and maintains a specific account for the borrower.\n",
        "- Lockbox: A control mechanism where customer payments are mailed directly to a P.O. Box controlled by the bank to prevent the borrower from diverting funds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Floor Plan Lending\n",
        "Used to finance inventory for retailers (e.g., automobile, boat, or appliance dealers). The bank pays the manufacturer, and the dealer repays the bank when the item is sold. The primary risk is \"Sold Out of Trust,\" where the dealer sells the collateral but does not remit the proceeds to the bank. Frequent, surprise floor check inspections are mandatory.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. LEVERAGED LENDING\n",
        "Leveraged lending involves loans to borrowers with a high degree of financial leverage (debt) relative to their earnings (EBITDA). These transactions are often used for buyouts, acquisitions, or capital distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Definitions:\n",
        "- Leverage Ratio: Commonly defined as Total Debt divided by EBITDA exceeding 4.0X, or Senior Debt divided by EBITDA exceeding 3.0X.\n",
        "- De-Leveraging: The borrower's ability to repay debt from free cash flow. A common standard is the ability to repay 50% of total debt within 5-7 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enterprise Value (EV)\n",
        "In leveraged lending, the secondary source of repayment is often the value of the business itself (Enterprise Value) rather than specific hard assets. Banks must rely on independent, well-documented valuations and stress-test the EV. If a borrower cannot de-lever and the loan relies solely on refinancing, the debt is often classified.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. OIL AND GAS (O&G) LENDING\n",
        "O&G lending is a complex sector where repayment relies on the cash flow from extracting underground reserves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reserve-Based Lending (RBL)\n",
        "Loans are secured by \"Proved Reserves.\"\n",
        "- Proved Developed Producing (PDP): Reserves currently being extracted. These are the most valuable (90% certainty of recovery).\n",
